When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Using a remote repository is a great idea for a few reasons. First, having a second copy
of my work stored somewhere else protects my work from hard drive crashes or other
disasters.  Second, it can make collaboration much simpler. By making my work available
online, it will be much easier for others to collaborate with me.
