What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initializing a git repository creates a repository in the current directory.
Before I can make any commits to a repository, I must create one with git
init.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area contains the files that will be included in the next commit.
It is different from the working directory, since the staging doesn't have to
contain all the files in the directory.  The staging arae is distinct from
the repository because a repository because a repository is designed to track
the changes in files in the current working directory over numerous commits.
The staging area is only used to designate which files should be included in a
single commit.
